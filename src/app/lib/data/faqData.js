    question: 'Will this finally fix the dead zones in my home?',
    answer: 'Yes. Unlike extenders or mesh kits, Luxifi uses hardwired access points placed strategically for full-property coverage. That means no more dropped signals, buffering, or WiFi black holes — just fast, stable connection in every room.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Why is my current WiFi so inconsistent — and how is this different?',
    answer: 'Most homes rely on a single router or plug-in extenders, which create weak or uneven coverage. Luxifi builds a professional-grade network using in-wall or ceiling access points wired directly into your system — so every device stays connected and strong.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Can I trust this setup to support all my smart home devices?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Our system is designed for modern living — whether you\'re streaming in 4K, running smart lights, or working from home. We build your network to grow with you and never let you down when it matters most.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'Do I have to switch internet providers to work with Luxifi?',
    answer: 'No. We enhance the quality of your internal network, not your ISP. You can keep your current provider — we simply make the connection you already pay for work better, faster, and more reliably throughout your home.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'I don\'t want ugly equipment or wires showing — will it look clean?',
    answer: 'Yes. Every Luxifi installation is discreet and design-conscious. Access points are sleek, cables are hidden, and everything is installed with care and craftsmanship to blend into your home\'s aesthetics.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'What if I already have some networking gear or WiFi installed?',
    answer: 'No problem. We\'ll evaluate your current setup, keep what works, and replace what doesn\'t. Whether you\'re starting from scratch or upgrading an older system, we create a solution that fits your home, your devices, and your goals.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'Do I need to know anything technical to use it day-to-day?',
    answer: 'Not at all. Once we install and optimize your system, you can forget about it. If you want visibility or control, you\'ll have access to an easy mobile app. And if anything ever needs support, we\'re just one call away.',

          question: "Why do I need a maintenance plan if everything works now?",
          answer:
            "Because true luxury is never having to think about it. Our plans keep your system running smoothly behind the scenes — no drop-offs, no surprises.",
        },
        {
          question: "Didn’t you already configure everything during installation?",
          answer:
            "Yes — and we did it right. But like any modern system, your network benefits from updates, tuning, and monitoring to stay secure and at peak performance.",

        {
          question: "My network is running perfectly — why change anything?",

        },
        {
          question: "Can I just update and manage things on my own?",
          answer:
            "Technically yes, but it's not about ability — it's about ease. Our plans take that responsibility off your plate, so you never have to lift a finger or worry about what’s next.",
        },
        {
          question: "What if I just leave it alone and never update it?",
          answer:

        },
        {
          question: "Don’t most routers or mesh systems update themselves?",
          answer:
            "Some do — but automated updates don’t replace professional oversight. We don’t just run updates — we analyze, adjust, and optimize your network based on your actual usage and needs.",

          question: "Is there a minimum charge for remote support or visits?",

        },
        {
          question: "Does Rapid Response mean someone will fix it in 2 hours?",
          answer:
            "We aim to address all critical issues ASAP — often within hours — but resolution time depends on the issue. The difference is: you’ll never be left waiting.",
