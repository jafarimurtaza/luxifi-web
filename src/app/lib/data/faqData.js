    question: 'Will this finally fix the dead zones in my home?',
    answer: 'Yes. Unlike extenders or mesh kits, Luxifi uses hardwired access points placed strategically for full-property coverage. That means no more dropped signals, buffering, or WiFi black holes — just fast, stable connection in every room.',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: 'Why is my current WiFi so inconsistent — and how is this different?',
    answer: 'Most homes rely on a single router or plug-in extenders, which create weak or uneven coverage. Luxifi builds a professional-grade network using in-wall or ceiling access points wired directly into your system — so every device stays connected and strong.',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: 'Can I trust this setup to support all my smart home devices?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Our system is designed for modern living — whether you\'re streaming in 4K, running smart lights, or working from home. We build your network to grow with you and never let you down when it matters most.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'Do I have to switch internet providers to work with Luxifi?',
    answer: 'No. We enhance the quality of your internal network, not your ISP. You can keep your current provider — we simply make the connection you already pay for work better, faster, and more reliably throughout your home.',
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: 'I don\'t want ugly equipment or wires showing — will it look clean?',
    answer: 'Yes. Every Luxifi installation is discreet and design-conscious. Access points are sleek, cables are hidden, and everything is installed with care and craftsmanship to blend into your home\'s aesthetics.',
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: 'What if I already have some networking gear or WiFi installed?',
    answer: 'No problem. We\'ll evaluate your current setup, keep what works, and replace what doesn\'t. Whether you\'re starting from scratch or upgrading an older system, we create a solution that fits your home, your devices, and your goals.',
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'Do I need to know anything technical to use it day-to-day?',
    answer: 'Not at all. Once we install and optimize your system, you can forget about it. If you want visibility or control, you\'ll have access to an easy mobile app. And if anything ever needs support, we\'re just one call away.',
  },
